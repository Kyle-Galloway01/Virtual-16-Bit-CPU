# Virtual-16-Bit-CPU
16 Bit CPU made with circuitverse


Creating a virtual 16-bit CPU with CircuitVerse is a great way to learn about computer architecture, digital logic, and electronics. By building and simulating your own virtual CPU, you can gain a deeper understanding of how computers work and how they execute instructions.

The 16-bit CPU is designed using CircuitVerse's visual block-based interface and is made up of a series of interconnected components, such as an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), a Control Unit, and various Registers. These components work together to execute instructions, perform calculations, and manage the flow of data within the virtual computer.

To create the virtual 16-bit CPU, you can use CircuitVerse's library of pre-made components, or you can design custom components from scratch. You can also simulate the CPU's operation and observe how it processes instructions and performs tasks.
